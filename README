CSignals
========

I was just reading the about standard C's signal and raise functions
and how not portable they are because almost every OS/implementation
handles things differently (see man pages).

I wanted to make a simple version of my own signals so here it is.
I'll probably rename the functions and possible refactor or add a few
things later, when I use this in a larger project.
